# Thinkful-Capstone-3

For my final capstone, I chose to analyze the relationship between the presence of women in film and that film's budget and gross revenue. Using a Kaggle dataset based on the Bechdel test, I looked into the differences between films that failed or passed said test.

I created my own research questions about the dataset and formally stated my hypotheses that I intended to test. Using z-tests, I definitively rejected or failed to reject my null hypotheses. I crafted visualizations in Python to help contextualize my story.
